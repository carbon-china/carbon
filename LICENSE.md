We can not talk about activated bamboo carbon without the mention of bamboo. There are more than 70 genera and more than 1,000 kinds of bamboos in the world, while China has 37 genera, which accounts for more than 50%, and more than 500 kinds of bamboos (including varieties), which accounts for about 42% in the world. Japan, ranking worldâ€™s second in bamboo species distribution, has only 12 genera and more than 230 kinds. In this way, we can see China's bamboo species are highly rich and diversified. Moreover, according to survey research, many bamboo species only exist in China, including more than 10 genera and 48 species.
